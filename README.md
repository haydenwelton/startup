Change from my development environment... and changed it again!!


I really enjoyed doing this project a lot becuase over the summer I worked at a tech company called Exemine and had to use Gitlab, Github, XCode and Tower all of the time to push, pull and merge conflicts for some apps we were working on so it was great to see this all again. Since I used Tower and XCode I haven't GitHub or VSCode to do this before so that was really interesting to learn how it works using a dedicated GitHub plugin for VSCode and do what I was doing before in a different way. Same principle but different roads.
